# How to Lose Money Fast: A Financial Analysis Project

## Overview
This project, titled "How to Lose Money Fast", is a financial analysis exercise demonstrating the pitfalls of improper data handling in financial modeling, specifically highlighting the bias introduced by using current market weights in historical analyses. The aim is to showcase how such practices can lead to misleading conclusions in financial strategies.

## Contents
- **Loading the Data**: This section deals with the process of loading the necessary financial data for analysis.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Here, we analyze the performance of financial strategies, illustrating the impact of using current market weights retrospectively.

## Objective
The primary goal is to educate about the look-ahead bias, particularly in the context of financial market indices like the S&P 500. We discuss how applying current market weights to historical data can lead to inaccuracies, particularly due to survivorship bias and the retrospective application of knowledge.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Financial Data Analysis Libraries (possibly pandas, numpy, etc.)

## Installation and Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can then run the Jupyter Notebook to see the analysis in action.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arielNacamulli/SurvivorshipBias
cd SurvivorshipBias
jupyter notebook
```

## Result
The code shows how to achieve this impossible performance.
